### Capstone Project: Predicting SpaceX Falcon 9 Success Landing

#### Objective:
Predict whether the first stage of SpaceX Falcon 9 will land successfully after launch using machine learning techniques.

#### Project Structure:

1. Data Collection and Wrangling:**
   - Utilize web scraping and RESTful APIs to collect launch data.
   - Convert JSON data into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.
   - Clean the data by handling missing values and filtering relevant features.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Perform EDA to understand the distribution and relationships in the data.
   - Visualize data using scatter plots, bar charts, and interactive plots with Plotly Dash.
   - Identify patterns and correlations that may influence the success of landings.

3. Interactive Visual Analytics and Dashboards:**
   - Build an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash to analyze launch records.
   - Include pie charts, scatter plots, and other visualizations to explore data insights.
   - Use Folium to create an interactive map to analyze launch site proximity.

4. Predictive Analysis (Classification):**
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train and evaluate different classification models such as SVM, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression.
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning using grid search to optimize model performance.
   - Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

5. Deployment and Documentation:**
   - Create a README file to document the project including:
     - Project overview and objectives.
     - Steps to reproduce the analysis.
     - Required libraries and dependencies.
     - Instructions to run the code and generate results.
     - Summary of findings and insights from EDA and predictive modeling.
     - Future improvements and potential extensions of the project.

#### Tools and Technologies:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and model development
- Plotly Dash for interactive dashboard creation
- Folium for interactive map visualization

#### Conclusion:
By predicting the success of Falcon 9 first stage landings, this project aims to provide valuable insights into cost-effectiveness and operational efficiency for space launch providers. The predictive model developed can assist in decision-making processes related to bidding and planning future launches.
